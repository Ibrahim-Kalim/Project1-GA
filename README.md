# Project1-GA
My game is going to be question game with 4 questins with four possible answers.
the game with display question on the top and the 4 answers for the player to chose form. On the bottom with be two button for Evalute and Next.
In HTMl will include first div with the ques and another div that hold all the anwsers, and last div to hold the button.
javascripts where all the main job to be done. One object to hold all the answers with question. To iterate throught it using forEach loop. Getting the options ready will be through opt1, opt2, opt3, opt4. And then Add the innerText by using the index. Add event click to chang the background color. Also another event listerner to see if the player chose the true answer to display green otherwise display red.
